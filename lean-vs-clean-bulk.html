            <h2>What Is Lean Bulking?</h2>
            <p>Lean bulking means eating slightly above maintenance calories with a clean, whole-food-based diet. You
                aim to build muscle slowly while minimizing fat gain. Most increase their intake by 200–300 calories
                daily and focus on progressive training.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>What Is Clean Bulking?</h2>
            <p>Clean bulking is similar to lean bulking but often involves a more aggressive calorie surplus (300–500
                calories or more) while still avoiding junk food. The goal is faster muscle gain, though with a slightly
                higher risk of fat accumulation.</p>

            <h2>Lean Bulk vs Clean Bulk: Key Differences</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Calorie Surplus:</strong> Lean bulk = 5–10% surplus. Clean bulk = 10–20% surplus.</li>
                <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Clean bulk builds muscle faster. Lean bulk is more controlled.</li>
                <li><strong>Fat Gain:</strong> Lean bulk keeps fat lower.</li>
                <li><strong>Diet Quality:</strong> Both emphasize whole foods, but clean bulks allow slightly more
                    volume.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Pros and Cons</h2>
            <h3>Lean Bulk</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>+ Less fat gain</li>
                <li>+ Easier transition to cutting phase</li>
                <li>- Slower muscle growth</li>
                <li>- Requires more precision</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Clean Bulk</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>+ Faster size gains</li>
                <li>+ Easier to hit calorie goals</li>
                <li>- May require longer cut later</li>
                <li>- Slightly more risk of fat gain</li>
            </ul>

        <section>
            <h2>When Should You Use Each?</h2>
            <p>Choose lean bulking if you're already lean or transitioning from a cut. Clean bulking fits better for
                hard gainers or during off-season mass phases. Your decision should align with your timeline, body type,
                and discipline.</p>
