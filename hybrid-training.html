            <h2>What is Hybrid Fitness Training?</h2>
            <p>Hybrid fitness training blends strength training, cardio, and stretching/mobility exercises. This
                approach builds muscle, improves endurance, and enhances flexibility. It also reduces injury risk by
                addressing all fitness components.</p>

            <h2>Why Injury Prevention Matters in Hybrid Training</h2>
            <p>Combining different workout types can overload your body if done incorrectly. Injuries disrupt progress
                and can cause long-term damage. Prioritizing injury prevention keeps you consistent and strong.</p>

            <h2>Steps to Prevent Injuries During Hybrid Workouts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Warm up:</strong> Spend 5-10 minutes warming muscles with light cardio and dynamic
                    stretches.</li>
                <li><strong>Use proper form:</strong> Focus on technique during every exercise. Use mirrors or record
                    yourself.</li>
                <li><strong>Include mobility drills:</strong> Daily stretching and mobility improve joint health and
                    reduce strain.</li>
                <li><strong>Balance intensity:</strong> Avoid pushing too hard every session. Mix intense days with
                    recovery.</li>
                <li><strong>Listen to your body:</strong> Rest or modify exercises if you feel pain or excessive
                    fatigue.</li>
            </ul>
