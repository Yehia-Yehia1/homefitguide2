            <h2>How to Set Up Your Cutting Phase</h2>
            <p>Start by calculating your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) using weight, height, age. For example:
                80 kg, 180 cm, 30 years → BMR ≈ 1800 kcal. Multiply by 1.4 → 2520 kcal/day maintenance.</p>
            <p>Apply a 15–20 % deficit (378–504 kcal) → 2000–2150 kcal/day. This supports fat loss of 0.5–1 % body
                weight per week while preserving muscle.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Protein Intake & Macronutrients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Protein:</strong> 2.0–2.2 g/kg (0.9–1.0 g/lb). For 80 kg person → 160–180 g protein daily to
                    preserve muscle.</li>
                <li><strong>Fats:</strong> 20–30 % of calories (44–72 g if eating 2000 kcal).</li>
                <li><strong>Carbohydrates:</strong> Fill remaining calories (≈ 230–300 g) to support performance.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>High protein maintains nitrogen balance. Moderate carbs fuel workouts.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Training Strategy: Strength & Maintenance</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Lift 3–5 times per week focusing on compound exercises.</li>
                <li>Use strength schemes like 5×5 or 4×8 for lower body and back.</li>
                <li>Add hypertrophy work (8–15 reps) for muscle fullness.</li>
                <li>Rest 1–2 minutes between sets.</li>
                <li>Progressively overload weekly—add small weight or reps.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This maintains muscle and boosts metabolism.</p>
        </section>

            <h2>Cardio: Effective but Controlled</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Include low-impact cardio (walking, cycling) 2–3x/week for 20–30 minutes.</li>
                <li>HIIT only once per week to avoid interfering with recovery.</li>
                <li>Don’t exceed 200 calories burned daily via cardio—focus first on diet.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Cardio supports fat loss without muscle loss if not excessive.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Recovery & Daily Activity</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Get 7–9 h sleep nightly—crucial for recovery and hormones.</li>
                <li>Add non-exercise activity (walking, standing) to increase daily calorie burn.</li>
                <li>Stay hydrated—aim for 2–3 L/day.</li>
                <li>Include mobility work and foam rolling for muscle function.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <details class="faq-item">
                <summary class="faq-question">What is cutting in fitness?</summary>
                <p class="faq-answer">Cutting refers to reducing body fat while maintaining as much lean muscle mass as
                    possible. It usually follows a bulking phase and involves a calorie deficit, higher protein intake,
                    and consistent training.</p>
            </details>
            <details class="faq-item">
                <summary class="faq-question">How do I avoid losing muscle when cutting?</summary>
                <p class="faq-answer">Maintain a small to moderate calorie deficit (15–25%), eat enough protein
                    (1.0–1.2g per pound), lift heavy weights regularly, and get enough sleep. These factors help
                    preserve muscle while losing fat.</p>
            </details>
            <details class="faq-item">
                <summary class="faq-question">Is cardio necessary during a cut?</summary>
                <p class="faq-answer">Not always. Cardio is a tool to help increase calorie expenditure. It supports fat
                    loss but should not replace weight training. Use moderate cardio if needed based on your calorie
                    needs.</p>
            </details>
            <details class="faq-item">
                <summary class="faq-question">How much weight should I aim to lose per week?</summary>
                <p class="faq-answer">Aim for 0.5–1.0% of your body weight per week. This rate reduces muscle loss risk
                    and helps maintain performance.</p>
