            <h2>What is Creatine?</h2>
            <p>
                Creatine is a natural substance found mainly in muscle cells. It helps produce energy during
                high-intensity exercise. Many athletes use creatine supplements to improve performance and increase
                muscle mass.

            <h2>How to Use Creatine</h2>
            <p>
                The common dosing method starts with a loading phase of 20 grams daily split into 4 doses for 5-7 days.
                Afterward, a maintenance dose of 3-5 grams daily keeps muscle stores saturated.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mix creatine powder with water or juice. Take it consistently, especially on training days.

            <h2>Possible Side Effects</h2>
            <p>
                Creatine is generally safe for most people when taken as recommended. Some may experience mild side
                effects like stomach upset or water retention.
            </p>
            <p>
                Consult a healthcare provider before starting creatine if you have kidney issues or other medical
                conditions.

                <summary>Is creatine safe to use daily?</summary>
                <p>Yes. Research supports daily creatine use as safe for healthy adults when taken within recommended
