            <h2>Why Protein Intake Matters</h2>
            <p>Your body uses protein to build and repair tissues. Whether you're trying to gain muscle, lose fat, or
                maintain your weight, getting the right amount of protein is critical.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Recommended Daily Protein Intake</h2>
            <p>Here's a general guide for protein needs:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> 0.8 - 1.0g per kg of body weight</li>
                <li><strong>Fat Loss:</strong> 1.4 - 2.0g per kg</li>
                <li><strong>Muscle Gain:</strong> 1.6 - 2.2g per kg</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To convert your weight to kilograms, divide your weight in pounds by 2.2</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Step-by-Step Calculation</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Weigh yourself in pounds</li>
                <li>Convert to kilograms (lbs รท 2.2)</li>
                <li>Multiply by the target protein factor based on your goal</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Example: If you weigh 160 lbs and want to build muscle:<br>160 รท 2.2 = 72.7 kg<br>72.7 ร 2 = <strong>145g
                    of protein per day</strong></p>
