            <h2>Understanding Stress</h2>
            <p>Stress is your body's natural response to challenge or demand. Short-term stress can help you perform
                better. Chronic stress causes serious health issues, including high blood pressure, heart disease,
                anxiety, and poor immune function.</p>
            <p>The American Psychological Association reports that 77% of people regularly experience physical symptoms
                caused by stress. Learning to manage it improves health and quality of life.</p>

            <h2>Effective Stress Management Techniques</h2>
            <h3>1. Deep Breathing Exercises</h3>
            <p>Breathing deeply activates your parasympathetic nervous system. This lowers cortisol, slows your heart
                rate, and relaxes your muscles.</p>
            <p>Try this technique:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Inhale through your nose for 4 seconds</li>
                <li>Hold for 4 seconds</li>
                <li>Exhale through your mouth for 6 seconds</li>
                <li>Repeat for 5-10 minutes</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Regular Physical Activity</h3>
            <p>Exercise improves mood and sleep, reduces anxiety, and boosts self-esteem. It also increases endorphins,
                your natural stress fighters.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1470658/" target="_blank">This study</a> shows
                aerobic exercise significantly reduces stress hormones.</p>

            <h3>3. Mindfulness and Meditation</h3>
            <p>Practicing mindfulness helps you stay grounded. It lowers stress by shifting focus from fear-based
                thinking to present moment awareness.</p>
            <p>Apps like Headspace and Calm provide guided meditations. Try meditating 10 minutes a day for 2 weeks.</p>

            <h3>4. Quality Sleep</h3>
            <p>Sleep restores your body and mind. Lack of sleep makes you more reactive to stress. The CDC recommends
                7–9 hours of sleep per night for adults.</p>
            <p>Sleep tips:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Go to bed and wake up at the same time daily</li>
                <li>Avoid screens 1 hour before bed</li>
                <li>Keep your bedroom dark and cool</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5. Social Connection</h3>
            <p>Talking with trusted friends or family reduces stress. Human connection lowers blood pressure, improves
                mood, and builds emotional resilience.</p>
            <p>Don’t isolate. Make time for people who support you.</p>

            <h3>6. Time Management</h3>
            <p>Overcommitment increases stress. Learn to say no. Prioritize what truly matters. Use tools like Google
                Calendar or Notion to schedule and track tasks.</p>

            <h3>7. Journaling</h3>
            <p>Writing helps you process emotions. You gain perspective and clarity. Try writing three things you’re
                grateful for daily. Gratitude rewires your brain to focus on the positive.</p>

            <h3>8. Limiting Stimulants</h3>
            <p>Caffeine and sugar spike cortisol and cause energy crashes. Reduce coffee intake. Eat balanced meals to
                keep blood sugar stable.</p>
