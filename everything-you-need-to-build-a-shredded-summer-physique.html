      <h2>Why the Summer Physique Matters</h2>
      <p>Summer physique isn't just about looking lean on the beach. It reflects discipline, health, and effort.
        The good news? You don't need perfect genetics. You need strategy and execution.</p>

      <h2>Start With Your BMR and Calories</h2>
      <p>Before doing anything, calculate your <a href="bmr-calculator.html">BMR
          (Basal Metabolic Rate)</a>. It
        tells you how many calories you burn at rest. Subtract 300–500 calories from that to begin cutting fat
        safely.</p>
