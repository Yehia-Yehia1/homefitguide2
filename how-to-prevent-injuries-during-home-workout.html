    <div class="author-date">By: Yehia Yehia | May 29, 2025</div>

    <p>Injuries can stop your progress. They cost time, focus, and motivation. You donâ€™t need a gym to train safely. You
        need awareness, preparation, and correct form.</p>

    <h2>1. Always Warm Up</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>5 to 10 minutes of light cardio</li>
        <li>Dynamic stretches to activate joints and muscles</li>
        <li>Prepare your heart, lungs, and nervous system</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Learn Proper Form</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Use a mirror or record yourself</li>
        <li>Follow certified trainers only</li>
        <li>Stop if you feel unusual pain</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Don't Skip Mobility Work</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Stretch your hips, shoulders, and ankles</li>
        <li>Use foam rollers and resistance bands</li>
        <li>Increase range of motion to reduce strain</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Choose the Right Surface</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Use a non-slip workout mat</li>
        <li>Wear proper shoes or go barefoot if it's safer</li>
        <li>Avoid training on tiles or uneven floors</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Progress Slowly</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Add weight, reps, or speed gradually</li>
        <li>Track your workouts</li>
        <li>Listen to your body, not your ego</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Rest When You Need</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Overtraining causes injury and burnout</li>
        <li>Sleep 7-9 hours every night</li>
        <li>Take at least one rest day per week</li>
    </ul>
