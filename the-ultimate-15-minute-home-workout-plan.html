      <section class="common-mistakes">
        <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
  <p>Even short workouts can be ineffective if done incorrectly. Here are some common mistakes to avoid when following a <strong>15-minute home workout plan</strong>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Skipping the warm-up:</strong> Starting without warming up can lead to injuries and reduce performance. Always prepare your body first.</li>
    <li><strong>Poor form:</strong> Rushing through exercises with incorrect form reduces their effectiveness and increases injury risk. Focus on technique over speed.</li>
    <li><strong>Not pushing hard enough:</strong> Short workouts need intensity. If you’re not breaking a sweat, you might not see results.</li>
    <li><strong>Doing the same routine every day:</strong> Repeating the exact same workout can lead to plateaus. Mix things up weekly.</li>
    <li><strong>Ignoring recovery:</strong> Recovery is just as important as the workout. Don’t skip rest days or sleep.</li>
  </ul>
