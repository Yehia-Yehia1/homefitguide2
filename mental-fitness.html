            <p><strong>Quick Answer:</strong> Mental fitness means keeping your brain active and healthy through
                exercises,
                good habits, and stress management. It improves memory, focus, mood, and overall cognitive function.</p>

            <h2>What Is Mental Fitness?</h2>
            <p>Mental fitness refers to the brain’s ability to process information, adapt to new situations,
                manage stress,
                and sustain concentration. It requires active care like physical fitness but focuses on cognition and
                emotional health.</p>

            <p>Just like muscles, your brain needs regular workouts through learning, problem-solving, and mindfulness.
                This maintains neuroplasticity — the brain's ability to form new neural connections.</p>
