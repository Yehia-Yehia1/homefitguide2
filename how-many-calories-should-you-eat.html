        <h2>Why Calories Matter</h2>
        <p>
            To lose weight, you need to burn more calories than you consume. This creates a calorie deficit. It's the
            only way to lose body fat consistently.
        </p>

        <h2>Step 1: Calculate Your BMR</h2>
        <p>
            Your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) tells you how many calories your body burns at rest.
            This number helps you understand your minimum calorie needs.

    <section>
        <h2>Step 2: Factor In Your Activity Level</h2>
        <p>
            Multiply your BMR by an activity multiplier:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sedentary (little or no exercise): BMR x 1.2</li>
            <li>Light activity (1-3 days/week): BMR x 1.375</li>
            <li>Moderate activity (3-5 days/week): BMR x 1.55</li>
            <li>Very active (6-7 days/week): BMR x 1.725</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Step 3: Create a Calorie Deficit</h2>
        <p>
            Subtract 300-500 calories from your total daily needs. This creates a healthy deficit that helps you lose
            0.5 to 1 kg per week.
        </p>
        <p>
            Avoid going under 1200 calories per day unless supervised by a doctor.
