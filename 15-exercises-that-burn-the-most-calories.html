            <p><strong>Quick Answer:</strong> The top calorie-burning exercises include running, jump rope, swimming,
                cycling, and HIIT. These workouts can burn between 500 and 1000+ calories per hour depending on

            <h2>Why Calorie-Burning Matters</h2>
            <p>Burning calories helps create a calorie deficit, essential for fat loss. Combining strength and cardio
                accelerates results. Exercise also supports metabolic health, improves insulin sensitivity, and helps
                with appetite control.</p>
