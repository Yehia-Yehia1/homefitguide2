            <h2>1. Cut Down on Processed Carbs and Sugar</h2>
            <p>Refined carbs spike insulin and store fat around your waist. Switch to whole foods like oats, quinoa,
                brown rice, and leafy greens. Cut soda and sweetened snacks entirely.</p>

            <h2>2. Focus on HIIT Workouts</h2>
            <p>High-Intensity Interval Training burns more calories in less time. Try 20 minutes of jump squats,
                mountain climbers, and burpees. No equipment needed.</p>
