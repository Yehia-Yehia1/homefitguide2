            <p><strong>Quick Answer:</strong> Most people start seeing noticeable changes in 4–8 weeks. Major fitness
                gains usually take 3–6 months of consistent training and nutrition. Fully conditioned fitness may
                require 6–12 months or longer depending on goals.</p>
