            <p><strong>Quick Answer:</strong> Older adults can safely begin HIIT with medical clearance, proper warm-up,
                low-impact intervals, gradual progression, recovery days, balanced nutrition, and attention to form.
                This article offers a full 2000+ word roadmap with modifications, sample workouts, nutrition, recovery
                strategies, common mistakes, and FAQs.</p>

            <h2>1. Why HIIT Benefits Older Adults</h2>
            <p>HIIT improves cardiovascular health, insulin sensitivity, bone density, and muscle mass—areas often
                declining with age. Even brief intervals stimulate growth hormone and improve metabolic function in
                seniors.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Boosts VO₂ max faster than steady cardio</li>
                <li>Preserves or builds lean muscle</li>
                <li>Enhances bone density through impact/movement</li>
                <li>Efficient: 15–20 minutes yield results</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>2. Safety First: Medical Clearance & Screening</h2>
            <p>Before starting, older adults should:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Get doctor clearance—especially with heart disease, joint issues, hypertension, diabetes, or
                    medications.</li>
                <li>Perform baseline testing: resting HR, BP, functional movement screening.</li>
                <li>Discuss medications affecting heart rate response.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Assess readiness using the <em>PAR-Q+ questionnaire</em>.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>3. Warm-Up & Mobility Warm-Up Essentials</h2>
            <p>Warming up for 10 minutes primes the body and prevents injury:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>5 minutes brisk walking or stationary bike</li>
                <li>Dynamic leg swings (10 each side)</li>
                <li>Arm circles and shoulder mobility</li>
                <li>Hip openers and ankle mobility</li>
                <li>Practice form for planned movements (e.g., bodyweight squats)</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>4. Low‑Impact Interval Modifications</h2>
            <p>Start with low-impact options:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>March in place high knees</li>
                <li>Stationary bike intervals</li>
                <li>Seated punch or paddle movements</li>
                <li>Step-ups on low platform</li>
                <li>Low-impact jumping jacks or skaters</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Use intervals such as 20 seconds hard effort, 40 seconds rest, repeat 6–8 times.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>5. Sample 4‑Week Beginner HIIT Plan</h2>
            <h3>Week 1 – Low Volume</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Warm-up → 5× (20 s effort / 40 s rest) → cool-down</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Week 2 – Add Reps</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>6× intervals, increase dynamic warm-up</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Week 3 – Increase Work Duration</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>8×(30 s/30 s) intervals, cool-down walk</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Week 4 – Include Strength Elements</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>8×(30 s effort + 10 s bodyweight squat + 20 s rest)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Train 2–3 days per week with rest days between sessions.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>6. Progression Strategies over Time</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Shift from 1:2 to 1:1 work/rest ratio</li>
                <li>Add resistance bands or light dumbbells</li>
                <li>Increase session count to 3×/week</li>
                <li>Introduce low-impact plyometrics if joints can handle</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>7. Nutrition for Older HIIT Participants</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Protein: 1.2–1.6 g/kg bodyweight to support muscle repair</li>
                <li>Carbohydrates: prioritize around workout (30–50 % of daily intake)</li>
                <li>Fats: include omega-3 rich foods to reduce joint inflammation</li>
                <li>Hydration: 2–3 L water per day, electrolyte support if sweat-heavy</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Older adults have lower protein absorption—spread evenly across meals.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>8. Recovery & Rest Days</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Full rest or very light movement one day after HIIT</li>
                <li>Use foam rolling, massage, mobility work</li>
                <li>Prioritize sleep—7–9 hours each night</li>
                <li>Use compression garments or ice baths if soreness persists</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>9. Tracking Progress & Adjustments</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Keep a log of workouts, perceived exertion (RPE), interval counts</li>
                <li>Track resting heart rate and blood pressure weekly</li>
                <li>Re-measure functional abilities monthly</li>
                <li>If RPE drops below 6/10, progress the workout</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>10. Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Skipping medical clearance or ignoring aches</li>
                <li>Using high impact too early—leads to joint strain</li>
                <li>Poor form during intervals—risking falls</li>
                <li>Not recovering—back-to-back HIIT without rest</li>
                <li>Poor nutrition—under fueling hinders performance and recovery</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>11. FAQs</h2>
            <details>
                <summary>Is HIIT safe for someone in their 60s or 70s?</summary>
                <p>Yes, if approved by a doctor and modified appropriately. Many older athletes complete HIIT safely
                    when progression and form are prioritized.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>How often should older adults do HIIT?</summary>
                <p>2–3 sessions weekly with at least one rest day between sessions is ideal to avoid overtraining.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Can HIIT help with mobility and balance?</summary>
                <p>Yes. HIIT often includes balance and coordination drills that improve proprioception and reduce fall
                    risk.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>What’s the best alternative if HIIT feels too intense?</summary>
                <p>Try moderate intensity interval training (MIIT): 1 min brisk, 1 min easy walk, repeat for 20 min.</p>
            </details>
