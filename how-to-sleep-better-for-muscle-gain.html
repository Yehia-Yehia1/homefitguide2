            <p><strong>Quick Answer:</strong> To gain muscle efficiently, you must sleep at least 7–9 hours per night.
                Deep sleep triggers growth hormone release and muscle recovery. Good sleep means faster recovery, more
                strength, and fewer injuries.</p>

            <h2>Why Sleep Matters for Muscle Growth</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Muscle recovery and repair mostly occur during deep sleep</li>
                <li>Growth hormone peaks during early night sleep cycles</li>
                <li>Poor sleep lowers testosterone and IGF-1 levels</li>
                <li>Lack of rest increases cortisol, which breaks down muscle tissue</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Research shows that sleeping less than 6 hours can reduce muscle protein synthesis by up to 60%.</p>
